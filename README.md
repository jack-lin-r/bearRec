# Flask Project Template
A simple flask project template with Bootstrap 3, jQuery, and a full testing suite.
 
Loosely based of [this Django project template](https://github.com/sloria/django-base-template). 
I toned down a lot of features from the original author and retained only what I usually need.

### Usage  

- Create your virtualenv
- `git clone https://github.com/kqdtran/flask-template PROJECTNAME`
- Rename the folder to your project name.
- `cd PROJECTNAME`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python run.py`

### Running tests
- Run tests using  `fab test`
- To enter "watch" mode,  `fab watchmedo`
